# Morse Code Translator
## This is a NOLOGY Challenge that requires cohorts to create a web page Morse Code Translator.

## MVP
-   It require the User Interface to look good but remain simple
-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text

-   Make sure to add unit tests for your translating functions

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
